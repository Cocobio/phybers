Segment
=======


This module incorporates a white matter fiber bundle segmentation algorithm, called FiberSeg, which is based on a multi-subject atlas. The algorithm is cited from :cite:`PGuevara-2012, LabraN2017, Andrea-Vazquez-2019`.

FiberSeg Description
--------------------


The FiberSeg uses as a measure of similarity between pairs of fibers the maximum Euclidean distance between corresponding points ( :math:`d_{ME}`), defined as:

.. math::
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ecua1}
    d_{ME}(A,B) = \min(\max_{i}(|a_{i}-b_{i}|),\max_{i}(|a_{i}-b_{N_{p}-i}|)) \quad \qquad [1]
    \end{equation}

where :math:`a_{i}` and :math:`b_{i}` are the 3D coordinates of the points of fibers A and B respectively, in direct order,
and :math:`b_{N_{p}-i}` are the 3D coordinates of the points of fibers B in flipped order. :math:`N_{p}` is the number of fiber points.

It aims to classify the subject fibers according to a multi-subject bundle atlas. The bundle atlas consists of a set of representative bundles and an information file.
The fibers of the atlas bundles are called centroids. The fibers of each subject are classified using a maximum :math:`d_{ME}` distance threshold for each bundle between the subjectâ€™s fibers and the atlas centroids.
The fibers are labeled with the closest atlas bundle, given that the distance is smaller than the distance threshold.

We provide one atlas of deep white matter (DWM) bundles :cite:t:`PGuevara-2012` and two atlases of superficial white matter (SWM) bundles, :cite:t:`Claudio-Roman-2017` and :cite:t:`Claudio-Roman-2022`. 
The following links provide access to these three atlases:

In addition to these atlases, we have tested our algorithm with the atlas :cite:`Atlas-Fan-Zhang-2018`, which contains both  DWM and SWM bundle.
If you need this atlas in data *'.bundle'* format, feel free to contact us via email.
