 > > ### _Description_

This module includes a white matter fiber bundle segmentation algorithm ([Guevara et al., 2012][Pg2012], [Labra et al., 2017][LN2017], [Vazquez et al., 2019][An2019]) based on a multi-subject atlas.  The method uses as a measure of similarity between pairs of fibers the maximum Euclidean distance between corresponding points ($d_{ME}$), defined as:

$$
d_{ME}(A,B) = \min(\max_{i}(|a_{i}-b_{i}|),\max_{i}(|a_{i}-b_{N_{p}-i}|))  \\ \\ \\ \\   [1]
$$

where $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ are the 3D coordinates of the points of fibers A and B respectively, in direct order, and $b_{N_{p}-i}$ are the 3D coordinates of the points of fibers B in flipped order. $N_{p}$ is the number of fiber points.

It aims to classify the subject fibers according to a multi-subject bundle atlas. The bundle atlas consists of a set of representative bundles and an information file. The fibers of the atlas bundles are called centroids. The fibers of each subject are classified using a maximum $d_{ME}$ distance threshold for each bundle between the subject’s fibers and the atlas centroids. The fibers are labeled with the closest atlas bundle, given that the distance is smaller than the distance threshold.

We provide one atlas of deep white matter (DWM) bundles ([Guevara et al., 2012][Pg2012]) and one atlas of superficial white matter (SWM) bundles, [Roman et al., 2017][cl2017]. Furthermore, other atlases are available for downloading from the Phybers website, such as a new SWM bundle atlas  ([Roman et al., 2022][cl2022]), and the DWM and SWM bundle atlas of [Zhang et al., 2018][zhang2018] in the format required by the segmentation algorithm. All the atlases are in the MNI space.

 > ## _phybers.clustering_
 > > ### _Description_
The module comprises two algorithms for clustering cerebral fibers, HClust (Clustering Hierarchical, [Roman et al., 2017][cl2017], [ 2022][cl2022]) y FFClust (Fast Fiber Clustering, [Vázquez et al., 2020][va2020])

 > > ### _phybers.clustering.hclust_
 > > > ### _Description_

HClust is an average-link hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm which allows finding bundles based on a pairwise fiber distance measure. The algorithm calculates a distance matrix between all fiber pairs for a bundles dataset ($d_{ij}$), by using the maximum of the Euclidean distance between fiber pairs (Equation [1]). Then, it computes an affinity graph on the $d_{ij}$ matrix for the fiber pairs that have Euclidean distance below a maximum distance threshold ( MaxDistance_Threshold). The Affinity ([Donnell and Westin, 2007][od2007]) is given by the following equation:

$$
a_{ij} = e^{\frac{-d_{ij}}{\sigma^{2}}}  \\ \\ \\ \\   [2]
$$

where $d_{ij}$ is the distance between the elements $i$ and $j$, and $\sigma$ is a parameter that defines the similarity scale in $mm$.

From the affinity graph, the hierarchical tree is generated using an agglomerative average-link hierarchical clustering algorithm. The tree is adaptively partitioned using a distance threshold (***PartDistance_Threshold***). 

> > > ### _HClust Functions_

def hclust(fiber_input=string, PartDistance_Threshold=int,  MaxDistance_Threshold=int, var=int, work_dir=string)
```
> > >### _HClust  Parameters_

The inputs are:
-	***fiber_input***: the tractography data file.
-	***PartDistance_Threshold***: a partition threshold (in $mm$), default $40$ $mm$.
-	***MaxDistance_Threshold***: a maximum distance threshold (in $mm$), default $30$ $mm$.
-	***var***: variance squared and provides a similarity scale (in $mm$), its default value is $3600$ $mm$
-	***work_dir***: the directory to store all the results generated by the algorithm.

The outputs files are:
-	***Clusters***: the directory that stores all the fiber clusters found.
-	***Centroids***: the directory that contains the centroids for each created cluster.
-	***Index of fibers per clusters***: a text file storing the fiber indexes for each of the detected clusters.

 > > ### _phybers.clustering.ffclust_
 > > > ### _Description_

FFClust is an intra-subject clustering algorithm aims to identify compact and homogeneous fiber clusters on a large tractography dataset.  The algorithm consists of four stages. The stage 1 applies Minibatch K-Means clustering on five fiber points, and it merges fibers sharing the same point clusters (map clustering) in stage 2. Next, it reassigns small clusters to bigger ones (stage 3) considering distance of fibers in direct and reverse order. Finally, at stage 4, the algorithm groups clusters sharing the central point and merges close clusters represented by their centroids. The distance among fibers is defined as the maximum of the Euclidean distance between corresponding points. The algorithm supports sequential and parallel execution using OpenMP.

 > ## _phybers.utils_
 > > ### _Description_
The ***utils*** are a set of tools used for tractography preprocessing and the analysis of brain fiber clustering and segmentation results. The module includes tools for reading and writing brain fiber files in bundles format, transform the fibers to a reference coordinate system based on a deformation field, sampling of fibers at n equidistant points, calculation of intersection between sets of brain fibers, and tools for extracting measures and filtering fiber clusters or segmented bundles. We considered the extraction of measures such as size, length and the distance between fibers of each cluster (or fascicle)

 > > ### _phybers.utils.deform_

```
 > > ### _phybers.utils.intersection_
 > > > ### _Description_

The bundle ***intersection*** sub-module calculates a similarity measure between two sets of brain fibers (fiber clusters or segmented bundles). It uses a maximum distance threshold to consider two fibers as similar. Both sets of fibers must be in the same space. First, a Euclidean distance matrix is calculated between the fibers of the two sets. Then, the maximum distance threshold is applied between fiber pairs and the number of fibers from one set that have a similar fibers in the other set are count, for both sets. The similarity measure yields a value between $0$ and $100\%$.

- ***dir_fib2***: path of the second fiber bundle
- ***outdir***: path to save the distance matrix
- 	***d_th***: istance threshold in millimeters used to consider similar two fibers

The outputs files are:
-	`intersection()` returns a tuple with the intersection percentage. The first value indicates the percentage of intersection of the first set of fibers compared to the second set of fibers, and the second value indicates the reverse scenario, intersection of the second set of fibers compared to the first set of fibers.

***Postprocessing*** sub-module contains a set of algorithms that can be applied on the results of clustering and segmentation algorithms. This algorithm constructs a Pandas library object (Dataframe), where each key corresponds to the name of the fiber set (cluster or segmented fascicle), followed by measures defined on the fiber set such as: size (number of fibers), intra-set distance and mean length (in $mm$). It can be used to perform single or multiple feature filtering on the clustering or segmentation results.

#
 > ## _phybers.fibervis_

 > > ### _Description_
The tractography files can be rendered with lines or cilynders. In the case of lines, the software loads the streamlines with a fixed normal per vertex, which correspond to the normalized direction for the particular segment of the streamline. Furthermore, a phong lighting algorithm [ABrainVis][abrainvis] is implemented in a vertex shader to compute the color fetched for the streamline. The MRI data is rendered by using specific shaders for slice visualization and volume rendering. Meshes can be displayed using points, wireframes or shaded triangles. The user interface (GUI) allows viewing several objects simultaneously, performing camera operations (zoom, rotate and motion), modifying material properties (color and adding transparency) and applying linear transformation (zoom, rotate and motion) on the brain tractography.

*Fiber selection based on 3D ROIs*

This function allows users to extract bundles using 3D objects and labeled 3D images, creating a point-based data structure for fast queries (called Octree). It is based on storing points inside a bounding box with a capacity of N. When a node is filled and a new point is added, the node subdivides his bounding box in eight new nodes (no overlapping each other) and the points are moved in the new nodes. The resulting selected fiber for each object can be used into logical mathematical operations (and, or, xor, not). This allows the use of multiple ROIs in order to find fibers that connect some areas, while excluding others that are selected by others areas.
